This is my first try at creating a web page on my own, no AI assistant, no teacher guiding me. It's very simple, but I learn as much as I did in my other tries combined. The Odin Project guides you without giving you the answer. 

Working with Git and WSL2 is a task that gives me a challenge and immense gratification. Navigating the PC inside the terminal is no longer scary. Sometimes, I forget how to copy documents from Windows to Linux. A simple web search refreshes my memory.

I want to continue and create a good-looking web page.
